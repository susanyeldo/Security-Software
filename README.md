# Aim:

Increasing security of Apartment Systems and minimising work of Human Security Guards

# What does our solution do?

If motion is detected in our camera, the image of the vehicle is captured and the licence number is read via OCR. The system checks if the licence number is in our database.

# USP of our solution:

Minimum difficulty to use as it has a very simple interface making it easily usable even by non-tech savy security guards.

# How to run the code on your system?
